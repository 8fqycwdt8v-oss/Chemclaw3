"""Agent tools for the fast calculators (plan step 1c.5).

Exposes cached calculators to the MAF agent as callable tools. Unlike the QM/HPC
path, fast calculators run **inline** (sub-second) — no durable workflow is
needed; the calculation store (Phase 1b) already makes a repeat call free and
idempotent. `default_store` names the production backend and is the seam tests
swap for an in-memory store.
