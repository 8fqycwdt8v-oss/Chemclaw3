# DECISIONS

Architecture decisions with rationale. Append-only; newest last. See `docs/architektur.md`
for full context (referenced section numbers).

## D-001 — Runtime is Python
MAF `SkillsProvider`, the Temporal SDK, and RDKit are all Python-native. One language across
orchestration, workflows, and cheminformatics avoids a polyglot seam.

## D-002 — MAF for orchestration, Temporal for durability (kept separate)
MAF orchestrates the conversation and short reasoning steps; Temporal owns the lifecycle of
long scientific jobs (QM/DFT). Merging both durability models is explicitly avoided ("a
torturous path"). MAF ↔ Temporal integration is one thin DIY adapter (no official adapter
exists), not a framework. §1, §2, §15.

## D-003 — Agent Skills (SKILL.md) for capability integration
Progressive disclosure keeps context lean vs. loading many MCP tools at once. Skills = domain
judgment ("when/how"); MCP servers = deterministic capability ("do X"). §3, §12.3.

## D-004 — Knowledge as a Markdown + Git graph (NetworkX), not a graph DB
Frontmatter makes notes structured-queryable; wikilinks encode real chemical relations;
retrieval is graph traversal (1–2 hops), not top-k vector similarity. Git gives versioning +
audit trail. No Neo4j/dedicated graph DB. §4, §10.

## D-005 — Human-in-the-loop via PR-gate
Every `created_by: agent` note (job results, campaigns, playbooks, report drafts) lands on a
branch/PR and needs human approval before merge. Built once, reused everywhere. §4.

## D-006 — One execution system: Temporal task queues, no pg-boss
Since Temporal already runs for HPC jobs, small async jobs (ELN sync, re-index, notifications,
reports) use a separate `background-jobs` task queue instead of a second queue system. §12.1.

## D-007 — First milestone: MAF + Temporal spine (HPC mocked)
Prove the async, durable job path end-to-end before building the rest; everything else hangs
off this pattern. `submit_to_hpc` is mocked so durability is testable without SLURM. Plan Phase 1.

## D-009 — Evaluation/metrics layer is first-class (Phase 2b)
The external review (docs/research-review.md) showed tool augmentation is not uniformly
beneficial (F8/F9) and that reproducible agent evaluation needs concrete benchmarks plus
green-chemistry metrics (F7). So scientific-output quality gets its own cross-cutting layer
(metric interface + eval harness + per-task tool-value A/B), and every later capability phase
must register ≥1 metric. This is what lets us apply Skills/tools *selectively and measured*
rather than universally. Chemical/biological safety is a *separate* concern and stays in the
backlog (user decision), not part of this layer.

## D-008 — Deep-research/report harness: one core, pluggable retrievers
The synthesis engine (decompose → fan-out → adversarial-verify → cite → synthesize) is
source-agnostic; internal sources (graph, fingerprints, ORD/analytical data, TabPFN) and later
external literature are interchangeable retrievers behind one interface. Long runs are Temporal
background workflows; drafts are PR-gated. Plan Phase 5b.
