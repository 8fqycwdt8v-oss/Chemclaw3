# DECISIONS

Architecture decisions with rationale. Append-only; newest last. See `docs/architektur.md`
for full context (referenced section numbers).

## D-001 — Runtime is Python
MAF `SkillsProvider`, the Temporal SDK, and RDKit are all Python-native. One language across
orchestration, workflows, and cheminformatics avoids a polyglot seam.

## D-002 — MAF for orchestration, Temporal for durability (kept separate)
MAF orchestrates the conversation and short reasoning steps; Temporal owns the lifecycle of
long scientific jobs (QM/DFT). Merging both durability models is explicitly avoided ("a
torturous path"). MAF ↔ Temporal integration is one thin DIY adapter (no official adapter
exists), not a framework. §1, §2, §15.

## D-003 — Agent Skills (SKILL.md) for capability integration
Progressive disclosure keeps context lean vs. loading many MCP tools at once. Skills = domain
judgment ("when/how"); MCP servers = deterministic capability ("do X"). §3, §12.3.

## D-004 — Knowledge as a Markdown + Git graph (NetworkX), not a graph DB
Frontmatter makes notes structured-queryable; wikilinks encode real chemical relations;
retrieval is graph traversal (1–2 hops), not top-k vector similarity. Git gives versioning +
audit trail. No Neo4j/dedicated graph DB. §4, §10.

## D-005 — Human-in-the-loop via PR-gate
Every `created_by: agent` note (job results, campaigns, playbooks, report drafts) lands on a
branch/PR and needs human approval before merge. Built once, reused everywhere. §4.

## D-006 — One execution system: Temporal task queues, no pg-boss
Since Temporal already runs for HPC jobs, small async jobs (ELN sync, re-index, notifications,
reports) use a separate `background-jobs` task queue instead of a second queue system. §12.1.

## D-007 — First milestone: MAF + Temporal spine (HPC mocked)
Prove the async, durable job path end-to-end before building the rest; everything else hangs
off this pattern. `submit_to_hpc` is mocked so durability is testable without SLURM. Plan Phase 1.

## D-009 — Evaluation/metrics layer is first-class (Phase 2b)
The external review (docs/research-review.md) showed tool augmentation is not uniformly
beneficial (F8/F9) and that reproducible agent evaluation needs concrete benchmarks plus
green-chemistry metrics (F7). So scientific-output quality gets its own cross-cutting layer
(metric interface + eval harness + per-task tool-value A/B), and every later capability phase
must register ≥1 metric. This is what lets us apply Skills/tools *selectively and measured*
rather than universally. Chemical/biological safety is a *separate* concern and stays in the
backlog (user decision), not part of this layer.

## D-008 — Deep-research/report harness: one core, pluggable retrievers
The synthesis engine (decompose → fan-out → adversarial-verify → cite → synthesize) is
source-agnostic; internal sources (graph, fingerprints, ORD/analytical data, TabPFN) and later
external literature are interchangeable retrievers behind one interface. Long runs are Temporal
background workflows; drafts are PR-gated. Plan Phase 5b.

## D-010 — HPC/DFT deferred; lead with fast local calculators (user decision)
The real HPC/SLURM DFT path is postponed. The mock spine (Phase 1) already proves the durable
async pattern, so early value comes from **fast, locally runnable** compute instead: semiempirical
**xTB (latest GFN, GFN2)** and ML predictors (**GNN solubility**, **pKa/property**). They reuse the
identical Temporal durability pattern; only the heavy HPC/DFT backend is wired later, when that
accuracy is actually needed and HPC access exists. Plan Phase 1c; DEFERRED.md row for HPC/DFT.

## D-011 — Results are persisted once, never recomputed (calculation store, first-class)
Every calculation goes through **one** result store keyed by
`(calc_type, calc_version, input_hash, params_hash)` — the calculator version is in the key so a
model/method update cannot silently poison the cache. One interface, swappable backend
(in-memory for tests, Postgres for real). This generalizes the QM-only step 1.10 into a
cross-cutting layer every calculator and every BO objective evaluation shares (DRY, no per-calc
cache). Plan Phase 1b.

## D-012 — BoFire is the Bayesian-optimization engine (no in-house BO), pulled forward
Optimization campaigns use the fast predictors + store as objective evaluations. We adopt
**BoFire** (domain modelling + BoTorch strategies) behind a thin adapter rather than building our
own BO; BoFire types stay encapsulated and never leak into the agent/skill. BO is pulled forward
from "defer until measured" because it drives which calculations are worth running. Plan Phase 1d.

## D-013 — MAF stays the orchestrator (reaffirmed vs. LangGraph)
Reconsidered MAF vs. LangGraph explicitly. LangGraph's main edge (durable/checkpointed execution)
is largely moot here because durability lives in Temporal (D-002); MAF's native Agent-Skills
(SKILL.md progressive disclosure) and Entra/Azure fit are load-bearing for our design. The agent
layer is kept thin and framework-swappable, bounding MAF's maturity risk. Decision: keep MAF.

## D-014 — Eval cases live outside the knowledge graph (own versioned dir, not notes)
Phase 2b's eval case-set is versioned in Git (reviewable, cited by the report) but lives under its
own `eval_case_dir` (default `evals/cases`), **not** under `knowledge_dir`. Reason: an eval case is
a structured evaluation payload (`output`/`reference` masses, predicted/actual, optimum), which the
relational note schema (`kg/note.py`: id/type/links/…) cannot carry, and putting such files under
`knowledge_dir` would make `kg-validate` reject them as malformed notes. So the metric layer parses
eval-case frontmatter directly instead of through `kg.note`. Regression gating is done by the test
suite (which pins each case's expected pass/fail), not by a CI hard-gate — because the seed set
deliberately contains a case that *fails* its gate to prove gating works. Plan Phase 2b.

## D-015 — Calculator contract now (`run_cached`), name-registry deferred
With three calculators sharing the same skeleton (xTB, solubility, pKa), the Rule of Three is
met, so the shared **contract** is extracted: `calc.store.run_cached` is the one place that
offloads a blocking calculator, stores the result as a plain dict, and reconstructs the typed
model — each `run_cached_*` now only derives its versioned key and delegates (DRY, plan 1c.1).
The **name→calculator registry** half of 1c.1 is deliberately *not* built: nothing dispatches a
calculator by name yet (the agent tools call each wrapper directly, and `bo.objectives` has its
own name registry). Adding a second registry now would be an abstraction with no second caller
(KISS) — it lands when a real name-dispatch consumer appears (e.g. a generic calc activity).

## D-016 — MCP capability servers live in `mcp_servers/`, not `mcp/`
The plan named the capability-server directory `mcp/`, but that package name is taken by the
installed MCP SDK (`from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP`). A local top-level `mcp/` package
shadows the SDK on `sys.path`, so `mcp.server` becomes unreachable and no FastMCP server can be
built. The directory is therefore `mcp_servers/`. This is a naming-only deviation from the plan;
the responsibility (deterministic capability, one small server per concern) is unchanged.

## D-017 — One generic fingerprint store for molecules and reactions
Reactions (DRFP) are the second fingerprint domain after molecules (ECFP4), so the
Rule of Three fired and the Tanimoto ranking, the record/Match types, the store Protocol,
and both backends (in-memory + Postgres) live once in `mcp_servers/fpstore.py`. A record is
a neutral `(id, label, bits)`; each domain supplies only its fingerprint function, its table
name, and its bit width (constructor params, both trusted constants). This mirrors the
calculation store (D-011): one ranking contract, swappable backend, no per-domain copy. The
molecule table column was renamed `smiles → label` to match (greenfield, CI recreates the DB).

## D-018 — ELN ingestion: ORD-subset schema, one JSON adapter, LLM-per-field deferred
Phase 4 keeps the canonical target schema (`eln/ord.py`) a **pragmatic subset** of the ORD
proto — only the fields Chemclaw consumes (structure, roles, amounts, headline conditions,
yield, provenance) — so there is no speculative schema and nothing above the adapter knows any
ELN's shape (G6). One concrete adapter is built (`JsonExportAdapter`, for a JSON-exporting
ELN), not a universal abstraction (generalize only from a third source — DEFERRED). Free-text
condition recovery is deterministic regex for the common cases; the **per-field LLM fallback**
(plan 4.4) is documented as judgment in the `eln-reaction-extraction` skill but not wired in
code — it needs a live model and is non-deterministic, so it stays out of the tested pipeline
until a real ELN needs it (same discipline as other LLM/infra-dependent deferrals). Ingestion
splits cleanly: the fingerprint index is a deterministic serving copy (not gated); the reaction
note is a knowledge claim (PR-gated, D-005).

## D-019 — Memory layers add no new infrastructure (note types + jobs only)
Phase 5's episodic (`campaign`) and semantic (`playbook`) memory reuses what exists: structural
identity comes from the fingerprint index's canonical-SMILES compound ids (Phase 3), the reaction
source is the ELN adapter (Phase 4), and every synthesized note enters through the one PR-gate
(Phase 2). Chain detection (`memory/chains.py`) links a product of one reaction to a reactant of
another; a chain of ≥2 becomes a `campaign` note citing its members. Cross-project structural
recurrence (`memory/playbook.py`, DRFP similarity across ≥2 projects) becomes a `playbook` note
with mandatory evidence. No new store, table, or queue — only new note types + background jobs on
the existing background-jobs queue. The LLM narrative/distillation prose stays in the two skills
(judgment), layered on the deterministic, tested skeletons.

## D-020 — Report harness reuses retrievers over existing data (no new store)
Phase 5b's report/deep-research harness turns the deep-research pattern (decompose → fan-out →
verify → cite → synthesize) inward onto internal notes. A stable, source-agnostic core
(`report/harness.py`) knows only the `SourceRetriever` contract; concrete retrievers
(`report/retrievers.py`) are thin adapters over the knowledge graph (Phase 2) and reaction
fingerprint search (Phase 3) — no new data store, and a future source (analytics, external
literature) is just another retriever behind the same interface. Citation is mandatory
(`EvidenceChunk.source_note_id`), unsupported claims are discarded (`verify_claims`, guarding the
`citations and all(...)` empty-list trap), unsupported sections are marked not invented, each
section declares its memory layer (structural provenance separation), long reports run as a
durable per-section Temporal workflow, and the draft is PR-gated. The decompose/synthesize prose
is the `development-report` skill's judgment on the deterministic, tested core.
