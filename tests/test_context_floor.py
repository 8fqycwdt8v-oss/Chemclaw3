"""What a turn costs before the user has said anything, pinned so it can only shrink on purpose.

Every tool this repository adds is free at review time and paid for on **every turn, forever**. The
2026-08-25 field benchmark measured the bill nobody was watching and, building this file, measured
it again properly: the default profile's prefix is **18,805 tokens** — 3,301 of instructions, 2,968
of the skills listing, and **12,536 of tool schemas** — against a compaction budget of 100,000 that
never sees it, because compaction acts on the *thread* and this is the prefix under it.

**The review's own figure was ~14,700 and it was low by 28%.** It estimated at `chars / 4` over a
hand-serialised name-plus-docstring-plus-schema; the number here is `convert_to_openai_tool`, which
is the function LangChain calls when it binds tools to a model, counted with the counter compaction
uses. Where the two disagree, this one is the payload.

**What it caught on its first encounter with somebody else's merge**, recorded because it is the
argument for the file existing: eighteen new tools and **+32% on the static floor**, in one change,
with nothing else in the repository saying so.

**This file is a ratchet, not a report.** It asserts a ceiling per profile. A change that grows the
floor fails here and the failure names the tool that grew, which is the whole point: the cost
becomes visible in the pull request that creates it rather than in a bill nobody reads.

**Why a ceiling and not the measured value.** An equality assertion fails on every docstring edit
and gets bumped without thought, which is a ratchet that turns freely in the wrong direction. A
ceiling with headroom is edited deliberately — and lowering one after a real reduction is the
commit that proves the reduction happened.

**Why `count_tokens_approximately` and not `chars / 4`.** The benchmark used `chars / 4` because
that is what `agent_context_token_budget` budgets against, which made its numbers comparable to the
code's own estimator. A *gate* wants the one function this repository can keep consistent, and
LangChain's counter is what the compaction middleware already uses. The two disagree by a few
percent; the ceilings here are set against this one.

load_profiles()

#: Per-profile ceilings on the static prefix, in tokens.
#:
#: One number, with roughly 10% headroom over the widest profile — enough for a docstring that gets
#: clearer, not enough to hide a new tool. A per-profile entry may be added when one earns a
#: tighter bound; the narrow profiles are far below this and would each take a much lower one.
#:
#: **Raised once, on 2026-08-25, from 21,000 to 27,500, and here is the number that raised it.**
#: The GFN multi-step work added *eighteen* agent-callable tools in one merge and took the `default`
#: profile's prefix from **18,805 to 24,838 tokens — a 32% increase in what every turn costs before
#: the user says anything**. That is exactly the event this file was written to make visible, and it
#: landed while this file was still on a branch, so the first thing the ratchet did was report a
#: cost that had already been paid.
#:
#: The ceiling is raised rather than the change blocked because blocking would punish this branch
#: for somebody else's merge. What must not happen is the raise being quiet: the figure is here, the
#: cause is named, and `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` carries the row for bringing it back down.
#: **Lowering a ceiling is the commit that proves a reduction happened**; raising one belongs in a
#: pull request description, not in a diff nobody reads.
#
#: **28,250 as of 2026-08-26**, raised from 27,500 by `profile_rotation`
#: (`D-2026-08-26-a-torsion-is-named-not-indexed`). Raising it is what this file asks for — the
#: cost of a new capability becomes visible in the pull request that creates it — and the number to
#: judge is what the tool costs *after* being narrowed, not before. That one measured 1,499 tokens
#: on arrival, over `MAX_SINGLE_TOOL_TOKENS` and second only to `start_optimization_campaign`;
#: trimming its manifest prose and moving two model docstrings into comments took it to ~870, since
#: pydantic publishes a model's docstring as its JSON-schema `description` and a nested pair of them
#: is bound to the model on every turn. The ~230 tokens that remain are what one more tool costs,
#: and that is the right thing to pay for it.
#:
#: **29,000 as of 2026-08-26**, raised from 28,250 by `rank_species_across_solvents`
#: (`D-2026-08-26-a-solvent-is-an-argument-not-a-job`), which measured 28,586 with it. The step is
#: the same size as the one above it and for the same reason, but the *cause* is worth recording
#: because it is not one tool: `profile_rotation` and this one were built on branches that did not
#: know about each other, each stayed under `MAX_SINGLE_TOOL_TOKENS` on its own, and the ceiling was
#: crossed only where they met. A per-tool bound cannot see that, which is exactly why this
#: whole-prefix ratchet exists beside it.
#:
#: This one arrived at 1,011 tokens — over `MAX_SINGLE_TOOL_TOKENS`, and that test refused it until
#: the manifest description and the spec's field descriptions were cut to what a model needs to
#: choose and call it, which took it to 857. The ~340 that remain are what one more durable job
#: costs on every turn.
CEILINGS: dict[str, int] = {"__default__": 29_000}

#: How much of the floor one tool may be. A schema above this is not expensive, it is *badly
#: shaped* — the fix is pagination, a narrower argument, or splitting a tool that does two things.
MAX_SINGLE_TOOL_TOKENS = 900

#: The two that are already over it, with what they cost on 2026-08-25.
#:
#: Recorded rather than hidden by a bigger bound, so the *third* one fails this test. Both are real
#: debt and neither is a mystery: `start_optimization_campaign` carries a BoFire campaign
#: declaration — objectives, constraints and parameter domains — as nested argument schema, and
#: `propose_knowledge_note` carries the note frontmatter contract. Each is a candidate for taking
#: its payload as one structured argument documented in a skill instead of as a wide signature.
