"""The agent's prose must only name capability the agent has (gap IDEA-7).

This check exists because two shipped defects were the same shape and no gate saw either:
`skills/experiment-design/SKILL.md` pointed the agent at `BoCampaignWorkflow` (no tool exposed it),
and `skills/deep-research/SKILL.md` named `find_similar_reactions(...)` when the agent's actual MCP
tool is `similar_reactions` — so loading that skill taught the agent three tool names that would
fail at call time. `mypy` cannot see prose, `pytest` did not read it, and `make skill-validate` only
checks frontmatter.
