# D-029 — The agent consumes fingerprint search over MCP (config-driven servers)

**Context.** The FastMCP servers in `mcp_servers/` (molfp, rxnfp) existed but the agent used
their capability *in-process* (`agents/search_tools.py` imported the search functions), so the
servers were dead relative to the agent path and "add a capability" meant editing agent code —
the gap the admin audit flagged and the architecture doc's "MCP servers hold capability" line
called for.

**Decision.** `build_agent` attaches each configured MCP server as a MAF `MCPStdioTool`
(`_mcp_capability_tools` over `settings.mcp_servers`, a list of `McpServerSpec`), so the agent
reaches structural search (`similar_reactions`, `similar_molecules`, `substructure_matches`)
over the MCP protocol. Adding/replacing a capability is a `CHEMCLAW_MCP_SERVERS` entry (JSON,
ENV-overridable), never a change to `build_agent`. `allowed_tools` restricts the agent to each
server's read/search tools — the `index_*` write tools stay off the conversational agent
(ingestion writes go through the PR-gate). Construction is lazy (no subprocess spawned in
`build_agent`, which stays synchronous); the run harness owns the MCP lifecycle
(`async with *agent.mcp_tools: await agent.run(...)`).

**Trade-offs accepted (the KISS tension, chosen deliberately by the user).** MCP transport adds
a subprocess boundary and per-turn lifecycle for what were local RDKit functions, and it moves
the in-process store test-seam out of reach for the agent path. Mitigations: (a) tool
*discovery* over stdio needs no database, so `tests/test_mcp_transport.py` spawns each real
server and asserts it advertises exactly its `allowed_tools` — the transport + config wiring is
verified in-sandbox; tool *invocation* stays covered by the Postgres-backed server tests in CI.
(b) `agents/search_tools.py` and its in-process functions are **kept** for `examples/
research_demo.py` (a deliberately credential-/DB-free in-process walkthrough) and their unit
tests — not dead, but no longer the agent's path. This duplication (in-process capability +
MCP transport) is the cost of the walkthrough staying runnable without Postgres/subprocess.
