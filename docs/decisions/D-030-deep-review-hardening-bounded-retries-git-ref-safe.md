# D-030 — Deep-review hardening: bounded retries, git-ref-safe slugs, git timeouts, cache keys

**Context.** A full-codebase review (six parallel review passes, findings independently
verified) rated the architecture and compute core clean but surfaced one concentrated risk
class in the Temporal retry/error-classification policy plus a few lower-severity robustness
and correctness gaps.

**Decision — fixes applied.**
- **Bounded bad-data retries (HIGH).** `workflows.publish.BAD_DATA_RETRY` had no
  `maximum_attempts`, so any exception whose class name was *not* in the non-retryable list
  (e.g. a deterministic `KeyError`/`RuntimeError`, or a git ref that can never be created)
  retried forever and pinned a worker. It now sets `maximum_attempts=settings.activity_max_
  attempts` (default 5) — bad data stays non-retryable by type, transient faults get bounded
  retries. The type list gained `ValidationError` (pydantic's `ValueError` subclass, matched
  by its own class name), `OrdFormatError`, and `EvalCaseError`; `note_publish_retry` now
  shares the same list (DRY) so a bad note fails fast instead of burning its retry budget.
- **Git-ref-safe note slugs (HIGH, composes with the above).** `kg.note.Note` accepted ids
  ending in `.` or `.lock`, which pass the slug schema but make git reject the `note/<id>`
  branch — a `GitSubmitError` that (pre-fix) retried unbounded and wedged the ELN sync. The
  slug validator now rejects a trailing `.` and a `.lock` suffix at the model.
- **Git subprocess timeout + kill (MEDIUM).** `GitNoteSubmitter._run` now bounds every git
  command by `settings.git_command_timeout_seconds` (default 60) and kills the child on
  timeout/cancellation, so a hung fetch/push can never deadlock the process-wide submit lock
  or orphan a git process holding `.git/index.lock`. `CancelledError` still propagates.
- **Cache keys include reported uncertainty (LOW).** The solubility and pKa calculation-cache
  keys now version on `solubility_rmse_log` / `pka_uncertainty`, so re-tuning the reported
  uncertainty recomputes rather than serving the stale value (the point estimate was already
  correctly keyed).
- **Test-skip narrowed (MEDIUM, test).** `tests/test_mcp_transport.py` skipped on a bare
  `except Exception`, which in CI could mask a real regression of the `allowed_tools` boundary
  (the D-029 line keeping write/index tools off the agent). It now skips only on a genuinely
  absent toolchain (`FileNotFoundError`/`ImportError`); anything else fails loudly.

**Consciously deferred (with reason).**
- **ELN reject re-drive.** The sync cursor advances past *rejected* entries (deterministic bad
  data — re-fetching only re-rejects). Rejections are reported in the summary and logged, not
  retried; correcting a source record upstream and re-ingesting is a manual/backlog action. A
  dead-letter/re-drive mechanism is over-engineering at current volume (KISS). Documented in
  `eln/sync.py`.
- **Fingerprint-definition versioning.** `molecule_fingerprints`/`reaction_fingerprints` store
  no record of the `ecfp_radius`/`ecfp_bits` that produced a row, so changing the definition
  and re-indexing alongside old rows would silently compare mismatched features. Latent (needs
  a config change *and* a re-index). Trigger to fix: the first time a second fingerprint
  definition is introduced — add a definition signature to the row + search guard (one
  migration). Tracked in `BACKLOG.md`.
- **KISS cleanups** (`gather_report`, `note_from_confirmed_answer`, `StoredResult.provenance`,
  the single-implementer `SolubilityModel` seam): left in place — each is plan-anticipated
  future wiring or a public batch API, not obvious boilerplate; deleting blindly is riskier
  than tracking. Listed in `BACKLOG.md` as conscious cleanup for the next touch.
