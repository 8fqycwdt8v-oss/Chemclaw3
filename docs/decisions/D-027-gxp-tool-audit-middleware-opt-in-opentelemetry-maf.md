# D-027 — GxP tool-audit middleware + opt-in OpenTelemetry (MAF out-of-the-box)

**Context.** With the logging floor in place (D-026), the two natural next tiers from the MAF
feature analysis were: a per-tool audit trail (a GxP "who ran what, with which inputs, did it
succeed" record and the first thing needed to debug an agent turn), and distributed tracing.

**Decision.**
1. **One function middleware audits every tool call.** `agents/audit.py::audit_tool_calls` is a
   MAF `@function_middleware` attached once via `Agent(..., middleware=[audit_tool_calls])`. It
   logs one line per invocation — tool name, truncated arguments, outcome, wall-clock latency —
   at INFO on success and WARNING on failure, re-raising the original exception unchanged
   (observe-only: it never edits arguments or results). This is the audit trail as a single
   reusable piece over all ~13 tools (DRY), not per-tool logging. Argument size is bounded by
   `agent_audit_max_arg_chars` so a large payload can't flood the log.
2. **OpenTelemetry is an opt-in toggle, not a forced dependency.** `chemclaw.logging.
   configure_telemetry()` is a no-op unless `CHEMCLAW_OTEL_ENABLED=true`; when on it calls MAF's
   `configure_otel_providers` once (reading the standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` env vars) at each
   worker's entrypoint. The OpenTelemetry **SDK + OTLP exporter are not installed** (only the API
   is, transitively), so enabling it requires an admin to add those extras — the toggle raises a
   directive error if they are missing, rather than us vendoring heavy tracing deps with no
   collector to receive them (KISS / "no dependency without a real consumer").

**Why this split.** The middleware is the high-value, zero-new-dependency deliverable and works
today; OTel is genuinely useful but only with a collector, so it ships as a config-flagged
capability an admin turns on deliberately. Structured/typed agent outputs (`response_format`) —
the third MAF-analysis pick — stays open in BACKLOG; it changes call sites, not startup wiring,
so it belongs with the feature that first needs a validated payload.
