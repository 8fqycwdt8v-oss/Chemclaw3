# D-022 — ELN carries step-by-step recipes; a second adapter reads native ORD

A late-development record is a *procedure* (charge → cool → dropwise addition → age → quench →
extract → crystallize), not one set of headline conditions. The canonical `OrdReaction` gained an
ordered `steps` list (`ReactionStep`: kind, verbatim text, optional components + per-step
temperature/duration) plus `procedure_text`, mirroring ORD's `inputs`(`addition_time`/`order`) +
`conditions` + `workups[]`. The flat headline fields stay the summary every existing consumer
reads; `steps` is a purely additive overlay that never feeds the reaction SMILES / fingerprints,
so search and metrics are untouched. Mass balance folds step-added species into the input element
set (a workup reagent can legitimately supply a product element). Two ingestion paths now feed the
one schema: `eln.json_adapter` segments free-text prose into labeled steps (lossless — text kept
verbatim, no SMILES guessed from prose; that stays the LLM skill's job), and `eln.ord_adapter`
maps native Open Reaction Database JSON into **component-linked** steps with unit conversion,
tolerating snake_case and camelCase. Both satisfy the one `ElnAdapter` contract and flow through
the same `sync_entries` pipeline; the reaction note now renders the numbered procedure so the
recipe survives to the graph for human sign-off.
