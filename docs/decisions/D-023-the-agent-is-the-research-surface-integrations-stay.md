# D-023 — The agent is the research surface; integrations stay dumb

The chat agent — not any single integration — is where intelligence lives. Data sources (ELN
free-text, native ORD, future analytics/literature) only map their content into the canonical
schema and the graph; the agent composes **every** tool and source to answer open-ended
questions and to propose new chemistry. Three moves:
(1) The fingerprint capabilities are now agent tools (`agents/search_tools.py`:
`find_similar_reactions`/`find_similar_molecules`/`find_substructure_matches`) — structural
cross-learning ("what was tried for this transformation", "what do we know when this functional
group is present"), previously built but unexposed.
(2) `agents/research_tools.py:gather_evidence` sweeps every internal source in one call behind
the report harness's `SourceRetriever` contract (graph over all note types ∪ reaction-fingerprint
search), returning note-cited chunks; adding a source later is one retriever in
`_text_retrievers`, no agent change. The `deep-research` skill holds the method: decompose any
question (any output — yield, impurities, observations — or general protocol guidance), gather
across similar *and* transferable-principle notes, keep evidenced fact separate from analogy, and
draft new conditions/protocols as PR-gated `protocol` notes (never asserted until a human merges).
(3) An **optimization campaign** (`memory/optimization.py`) is a new episodic grouping: repeated
runs of the *same* transformation (DRFP-similar, tight threshold), laid out as a comparative
conditions×outcomes table citing each run — the substrate for "what moved the result". The DRFP
clustering that playbook and optimization now share is extracted to `memory/similarity.py`
(Rule-of-Three). The memory corpus reads from **all** ELN adapters, not just the free-text one.
