# D-009 — Evaluation/metrics layer is first-class (Phase 2b)

The external review (docs/research-review.md) showed tool augmentation is not uniformly
beneficial (F8/F9) and that reproducible agent evaluation needs concrete benchmarks plus
green-chemistry metrics (F7). So scientific-output quality gets its own cross-cutting layer
(metric interface + eval harness + per-task tool-value A/B), and every later capability phase
must register ≥1 metric. This is what lets us apply Skills/tools *selectively and measured*
rather than universally. Chemical/biological safety is a *separate* concern and stays in the
backlog (user decision), not part of this layer.
