# D-020 — Report harness reuses retrievers over existing data (no new store)

Phase 5b's report/deep-research harness turns the deep-research pattern (decompose → fan-out →
verify → cite → synthesize) inward onto internal notes. A stable, source-agnostic core
(`report/harness.py`) knows only the `SourceRetriever` contract; concrete retrievers
(`report/retrievers.py`) are thin adapters over the knowledge graph (Phase 2) and reaction
fingerprint search (Phase 3) — no new data store, and a future source (analytics, external
literature) is just another retriever behind the same interface. Citation is mandatory
(`EvidenceChunk.source_note_id`), unsupported claims are discarded (`verify_claims`, guarding the
`citations and all(...)` empty-list trap), unsupported sections are marked not invented, each
section declares its memory layer (structural provenance separation), long reports run as a
durable per-section Temporal workflow, and the draft is PR-gated. The decompose/synthesize prose
is the `development-report` skill's judgment on the deterministic, tested core.
