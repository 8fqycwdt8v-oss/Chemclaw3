# D-019 — Memory layers add no new infrastructure (note types + jobs only)

Phase 5's episodic (`campaign`) and semantic (`playbook`) memory reuses what exists: structural
identity comes from the fingerprint index's canonical-SMILES compound ids (Phase 3), the reaction
source is the ELN adapter (Phase 4), and every synthesized note enters through the one PR-gate
(Phase 2). Chain detection (`memory/chains.py`) links a product of one reaction to a reactant of
another; a chain of ≥2 becomes a `campaign` note citing its members. Cross-project structural
recurrence (`memory/playbook.py`, DRFP similarity across ≥2 projects) becomes a `playbook` note
with mandatory evidence. No new store, table, or queue — only new note types + background jobs on
the existing background-jobs queue. The LLM narrative/distillation prose stays in the two skills
(judgment), layered on the deterministic, tested skeletons.
