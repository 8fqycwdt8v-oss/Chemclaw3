# D-025 — The agent keeps its chat thread within a token budget (MAF compaction)

**Decision.** The MAF agent now carries an `InMemoryHistoryProvider` (so a session accumulates a
thread) and a `CompactionProvider` that keeps that thread within a configurable token budget —
built in `agents/chemclaw_agent.py:_build_compaction`. Compaction fires **only when the included
context exceeds `agent_context_token_budget`** ("reduce when applicable"), then reclaims tokens
cheapest-first via a `TokenBudgetComposedStrategy`:
1. `ToolResultCompactionStrategy` — collapse older tool-result payloads (the big `gather_evidence`
   sweeps and full `expand_note` recipes) into a short cited `[Tool results: …]` trace, keeping the
   newest `agent_keep_last_tool_groups` verbatim.
2. `SlidingWindowStrategy` — drop conversation turns older than `agent_keep_last_conversation_groups`.
3. The composed strategy's built-in fallback excludes the oldest groups if still over budget.
System instructions and skills are always preserved. The same strategy runs `before_run` (guard the
model input) and `after_run` (shrink persisted history so the next turn starts smaller).

**Why this shape.** (a) Tool results are Chemclaw's largest context consumers, so collapsing them
first is the highest-value, cheapest move and keeps a readable, still-cited trace. (b) **No LLM
summarizer** — the char/4 `CharacterEstimatorTokenizer` and deterministic strategies need no extra
credentials, stay reproducible/testable, and avoid the indirect-prompt-injection risk MAF documents
for `SummarizationStrategy` (a compromised summarizer would persist unsafe text in history). (c)
Durability stays in Temporal — this is conversation-context management, not job state (layer rule
intact). Knobs live in the one config source (`CHEMCLAW_AGENT_CONTEXT_TOKEN_BUDGET`,
`…_KEEP_LAST_TOOL_GROUPS`, `…_KEEP_LAST_CONVERSATION_GROUPS`). This complements the existing
per-answer frugality (capped `gather_evidence`, sized excerpts, offline distillation into campaign
notes). `SummarizationStrategy` remains a documented opt-in (DEFERRED).
