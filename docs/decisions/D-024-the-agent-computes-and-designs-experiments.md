# D-024 — The agent computes and designs experiments proactively, not just retrieves

**Decision.** Two capability gaps found while checking whether the agent behaves autonomously
are closed, and a token-frugality bound is added:

(1) *Proactive property computation.* The fast calculators (`predict_solubility`, `predict_pka`,
`compute_xtb_energy`) were already agent tools; the instructions and `deep-research` skill now
tell the agent to invoke them *unprompted* when a question turns on a property the record does
not state — e.g. weighing an untried solvent against the ones in the ELN — folding the
prediction (with its uncertainty) into the answer instead of leaving the gap.

(2) *Next-experiment design.* BoFire existed only as the durable `BoCampaignWorkflow` (an
automated closed loop). A "which experiment/condition next?" question is a single ask, not a
campaign, so `agents/bo_tools.py:suggest_next_experiment` exposes BoFire's ask step inline (GP
fit off the event loop, like the calculators): the agent frames the decision space + the
historic runs it gathered and gets the next point(s) to try — proposals a human runs, gated as
`experiment-batch` notes if recorded. Judgment lives in the new `experiment-design` skill; the
neutral `bo.problem` types cross the boundary, never BoFire (G6). The durable workflow remains
the path for a self-evaluating multi-round loop. **TabICL/TabPFN stays deferred** — it needs a
model download + license check, and BoFire covers the design question today.

(3) *Context-window budget.* `gather_evidence` caps its sweep at
`gather_evidence_max_chunks` (config, default 40) so a broad question over a large corpus fills
only as much context as it needs; the agent narrows the query or drills in with `expand_note`
when truncated. This complements the two existing frugality mechanisms — bounded excerpts
(`report_excerpt_chars`) and offline memory-synthesis jobs that pre-digest many runs into one
comparative `optimization-campaign` note, so the agent reads a distillation instead of N raw
recipes.

`examples/research_demo.py` demonstrates the whole loop (gather → cross-learn → proactive
compute → next experiment) over a seeded in-memory corpus with **no LLM and no database**, and
is covered by `tests/test_research_demo.py`.
