# BACKLOG

Prioritized open action items. Top = next. Keep in sync with `docs/implementation-plan.md`
(phase/step numbers) at session end.

## Now — Phase 2: knowledge graph + PR-gate
- [x] 2.1 Note schema (`kg/note.py`, one pydantic model); 2.2 parser (frontmatter → Note, clear errors).
- [x] 2.3 Wikilink extraction + NetworkX indexer (`kg/graph.py`, `neighborhood` 1–2 hop traversal).
- [x] 2.4 Validation CLI (`kg/validate.py`, `make kg-validate`) — broken links / dup ids / bad notes; in CI.
- [x] 2.5/2.6 skills `knowledge-graph-query` + `knowledge-graph-write` (judgment).
- [x] 2.7 **PR-gate** built once (`kg/pr_gate.py` `propose_note` + `NoteSubmitter` seam + `kg/render.py`);
      agent-only, notes land at `<knowledge_dir>/<type>/<id>.md` on a per-note branch. Tested with a fake.
- [x] 2.6b real `NoteSubmitter`: `kg/git_submitter.py` `GitNoteSubmitter` (branch off base, write, commit,
      push) — tested against a local bare remote. PR-object creation is the git platform's step.
- [x] 2.8 Temporal activity `write_knowledge_node` (`workflows/knowledge.py`): QM result → agent
      `job-result` note (links to a method-independent compound id) → PR-gate. Registered on the bg worker.
- [x] Agent tools for graph query/write (`agents/graph_tools.py`: find_notes, expand_note,
      propose_knowledge_note) registered on the MAF agent; shared `default_submitter` (DRY).
- [x] Wire `write_knowledge_node` into a workflow caller: `QMJobWorkflow` gains opt-in
      `publish_to_graph`, routing the note write to the background-jobs queue (best-effort). Server test.
- [x] CHECKMATE 2 (G1–G7 + deep review over Phase 1+2): 5 findings fixed — (F1) bounded retry so
      best-effort publish gives up instead of hanging; (F2) job-result note no longer dangling-links a
      non-existent compound note (would fail kg-validate); (F3) git submitter idempotent on identical
      re-submit; (F4) stray `body:` frontmatter key no longer crashes the parser; (F5) dedicated
      note-write timeout/attempts config. **Phase 2 complete.**

## Later compute items (reprioritized; HPC/DFT deferred — D-010)

### Phase 1b — Result store / calc cache (first-class; "never compute twice") — DONE
- [x] 1b.1 Store interface `get/put` (Protocol); 1b.2 versioned key `(calc_type, calc_version, input_hash, params_hash)`.
- [x] 1b.3 In-memory backend (tests) + Postgres backend (`calculation_results` table) + `make db-migrate` + CI DB.
- [x] 1b.4 One `cached_compute()` path (lookup-before-compute, DRY); returns was_cached for hit/miss metric.
- [ ] 1b.5 Temporal lookup/persist activities — fold into 1c.5 (generic CalculationWorkflow) to avoid a stub.

### Phase 1c — Fast predictors + semiempirical (first *real* calculations)
- [x] 1c.2 **xTB / GFN2** calculator via `tblite` (real single-point energy, RDKit 3D embed, CPU) —
      `calc/xtb.py`, cached through the store (`run_cached_xtb`). Real GFN2 tests run everywhere.
- [ ] 1c.1 Calculator contract + registry — build when the 2nd calculator (solubility) lands (Rule of Three).
- [ ] 1c.3 GNN solubility model (inference only; value + uncertainty) — **needs model choice** (see open Qs).
- [x] 1c.4 **pKa via xTB** (`calc/pka.py`): GFN2-xTB ALPB-solvated deprotonation energy of the most
      acidic O-H/S-H site + linear calibration (R²0.93 over 10 acids). Agent tool `predict_pka`. Real tests.
- [x] 1c.5/1c.6 xTB exposed to the MAF agent as tool `compute_xtb_energy` + `calculation-selection` skill.
- [ ] 1c.5b generalize to a calculator registry once the 2nd calculator lands (solubility/pKa).
- [ ] 1c.7 optional graph note via PR-gate. CHECKMATE 1c.
- Note: fast calcs run **without** a Temporal workflow (sub-second) — the store gives "never twice";
  durability (Temporal) is reserved for long jobs (BO campaigns 1d, later HPC).

### Phase 1d — Bayesian optimization (BoFire, pulled forward)
- [x] 1d.1 Domain adapter (`bo/engine.py`, BoFire fully encapsulated behind neutral `bo/problem.py` types).
- [x] 1d.2 ask/tell: `initial_candidates` (random seed) + `propose_candidates` (SOBO); `optimize()` loop
      (`bo/campaign.py`) — convergence-tested on known minima/maxima (CHECKMATE 1d spike met).
- [x] 1d.2b categorical BO support (`CategoricalParameter`) + real reaction benchmark:
      **Reizman Suzuki–Miyaura** (`bo/benchmarks/reizman_suzuki.py`, data vendored from Summit/MIT),
      RandomForest yield surrogate → BoFire mixed categorical+continuous campaign beats dataset median.
- [x] 1d.4 **durable BO campaign**: `BoCampaignWorkflow` (Temporal) + activities (heavy BoFire work
      isolated) + `bo/objectives.py` name→objective registry + **`workers/background_worker.py`**
      (first real background-jobs job — retro-satisfies 1.8, no empty stub). Server test runs in CI.
- [x] 1d.3 **calculator-backed objective**: `solubility_objective(store)` (cached solubility via the
      store) registered as `solubility_max`, plus `molecule_library_problem`. **Candidate-set BO works**:
      BoFire drives a pure-categorical domain by exhaustive-discrete acquisition — finds a top molecule
      without evaluating the whole library (test: best found evaluating 9/14). Constraint: evaluation
      budget must be < library size, else the unique-candidate pool exhausts.
- [x] Robustness: `optimize` and the durable BO workflow stop gracefully when a discrete candidate
      set is exhausted (`discrete_candidate_count`/`distinct_candidate_count` guard) instead of crashing
      inside BoFire. Tests: budget 2+10 over a 4-molecule library returns cleanly.
- [ ] 1d.5 candidates PR-gated (after Phase 2); 1d.6 progress/regret metric (after Phase 2b). CHECKMATE 1d full.

## Done
- [x] **Phase 0** — foundation (tooling, config, infra compose, CI, ADR-0001, layer READMEs). CHECKMATE 0 green.
- [x] **Phase 1 spine (1.1–1.6, 1.9)** — hpc worker; `QMJobWorkflow` + activities (mock HPC, heartbeat poll,
      parse); agent tools `submit_qm_job`/`get_qm_job_status`; MAF agent + `qm-job-submission` skill;
      `requested_by` audit field; shared Temporal client + result models. Server-backed tests run in CI.
- [x] **Orchestrator** — reconsidered MAF vs LangGraph → keep MAF (D-013).
- Folded/deferred Phase-1 tails: **1.7** notify callback (defer until an async result must reach a live
  session); **1.8** background-jobs worker — **DONE** (`workers/background_worker.py`, hosts the BO
  campaign); **1.10** → generalized into **Phase 1b**. **CHECKMATE 1** (worker-restart durability spike)
  runs against a live Temporal (`make up`) — pending, needs a live cluster (not runnable in sandbox).

## Capability gaps to triage (from `docs/research-review.md`) — decide per item
- [x] **Evaluation / scientific-output metrics layer** → promoted to first-class **Phase 2b**
      (see plan + D-009). No longer a backlog decision.
- [ ] **Chemical/biological safety layer** — distinct from Entra-ID/RBAC (IT security).
      GxP / data-integrity + hazard checks. **Kept in backlog** (user decision); decide scope
      before any capability phase that could propose a hazardous route/procedure.
- [ ] Retrosynthesis + reaction prediction · DoE/Bayesian optimization · lab automation/SiLA2
      closed-loop · process flowsheet synthesis · multimodal analytical data · domain foundation
      models — all currently in `DEFERRED.md` with triggers; confirm or pull forward.
- [ ] Design cautions to bake in: apply Skills/tools **selectively + measured per task** (not
      universally); design the CoALA memory layer against DMR/LongMemEval, not by assumption.

## Open questions / awaiting input (see `docs/research-review.md`)
- [ ] **"pKs models"** — interpreted as **pKa** prediction; confirm (could mean PK/ADMET). The
      pluggable calculator registry (1c.1) makes a rename/swap cheap.
- [ ] **Which models** for solubility (GNN weights + license?) and pKa (tool/model)? xTB binary
      availability + license in the target runtime.
- [ ] BoFire scope for v1: which problem (reaction-condition? formulation?) is the first real BO case?
- [ ] Temporal vs. Restate/DBOS/Prefect/Dapr — no head-to-head source found; our choice stands
      on maturity/fit. Revisit if operability/cost becomes a concern.
- [ ] When does Markdown+NetworkX tip to Neo4j/Memgraph + GraphRAG? (deterministic traversal
      sidesteps the NL-query risk for now.)
- [ ] Concrete lab-automation/SiLA2 + DoE + retrosynthesis integration wiring.
- [ ] Domain safety/compliance layer design beyond RBAC.

## Later
- [ ] Phase 2 knowledge-graph core + PR-gate · Phase 3 fingerprint search · Phase 4 ELN
      ingestion · Phase 5 memory layers · Phase 5b report harness · Phase 6 identity/RBAC.
